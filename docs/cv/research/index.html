<p>The following figure shows the <a href="https://www.wordclouds.com/">Wordcloud</a>
of the abstracts of my papers. After a stemming process, the 50 most
frequent terms in the abstracts are shown with a size that is
proportional to their frequency.</p>
<p><img src="../../../img/WC.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The most evident terms (i.e. the biggest, namely the more frequent in
the abstract) well summarize my research that focus on <strong>wireless
networks for the collection of data</strong> to provide useful <strong>services to
the users</strong>. This activity, is nowadays part of the wider research on
the Internet of Things (IoT) and more recently naturally brought me to
start an investigation on Decentralized Applications and Blockchain
Technologies.</p>
<p>A distinctive characteristics of my research is the attempt to always
validate the performance of the proposed solutions, both theoretical and
practical, via simulations and real testbeds.</p>
<p>I lead the research activities on wireless sensor networks and the
Internet of Things, in the research group on Computer Networks and
Pervasive Systems of the Department of Automatic Computer Engineering
and Management Antonio Ruberti della Sapienza University of Rome (DIAG).
In this context, I enjoied the cooperation with several international
research organizations, including: Research Academic Computer Technology
Institute (Greece), Braunschweig University of Technology (Germany),
Universitat Paderborn (Germany), University of Athens (Greece),
Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (Israel), University of Salerno
(Italy), Wroclaw University of Technology (Poland), Universitat
Politecnica de Catalunya (Spain), University of Geneva (Switzerland),
University of Lubeck (Germany).</p>
<p>I founded the laboratory on the wireless sensor network of DIAG where
the solutions - both hardware and software - designed in the our
research activities, are implemented and tested in the field.</p>
<p>I enjoy a long term collaboration on cooperative design and co-design
with faculties of the MSc in Product Design at Sapienza. In particular,
I’m leading the research activities on the employment of genetic
algorithms for product design.</p>
<h2 id="wireless-networks-for-the-collection-of-data">Wireless Networks for the Collection of Data</h2>
<h3 id="allocation-problems">Allocation Problems</h3>
<p>Coloring algorithms can be used to model bandwidth allocation problems
in FDMA systems. In [1] we present randomized lower bounds for online
coloring of some well studied network topologies. Wireless data networks
allow multiple codes (or channels) to be allocated to a single user,
where each code can support multiple data rates. Providing fine-grained
QoS to users in such networks poses the two-dimensional challenge of
assigning both power (rate) and codes to every user [2],[3]. A
similar “two-dimensional challenge” emerges in the allocation of
bandwidth slots to communication requests on a satellite channel under
real time constraints. Accepted requests must be scheduled on
non-intersecting rectangles in the time/bandwidth Cartesian space with
the goal of maximizing the benefit obtained from accepted requests.
[4]</p>
<h3 id="data-collection-and-energy-consumption">Data collection and energy consumption</h3>
<p>Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are made of battery powered nodes,
consequently the energy consumption of the nodes must be optimized to
increase the network life-time. WSN are deployed to monitor a phenomenon
and in a very simplistic setting we can identify two main phases: a) the
<em>interest dissemination</em>, where the nodes are notified on the phenomenon
they have to observe, and b) the <em>data collection</em> where the nodes
report the observed data. In [5],[6] we tackle the problem of
designing simple, localized, low energy consuming, reliable protocols
for one-to-all communication (namely the main paradigm for
interest-dissemination) in large scale wireless sensor networks. Data
aggregation can be used to combine data of several sensors into a single
message, thus reducing sensor communication costs during the data
collection phase, at the expense of message delays. Thus, the main
problem of data aggregation is to balance the communication and delay
costs [7],[8],[9],[10]. In [11], [12], [13] we presented
solutions capable to integrate the data delivery and interest
dissemination techniques. Duty cycling is a useful technique that
alternates active and inactive periods to reduce the power consumption.
In [14] we presented a protocol capable to automatically adapt the
duty-cycle to the application needs. The protocol has been also tested
to extend TETRA, a European standard for a trunked radio system, with
WSNs [15].</p>
<p>Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) exploit user mobility to deliver
messages. In [16],[17],[18],[19],[20],][21] we propose a a
reference architecture and a thorough quantitative evaluation of routing
protocols for DTNs. Population protocols are used as a theoretical model
for a collection (or population) of tiny mobile agents that interact
with one another to carry out a computation. In [22] we evaluate the
performance of population protocols on real face-to-face social networks
of mobile users [25]. In [26] we studied how to exploit the energy
scavenged by the pedestrian movements to enhance the operation time of
the sensors. In [27],[28] we studied how to enhance the capabilities
of multi-robot surveillance with WSNs.</p>
<h3 id="simulation-tools-deployments-and-devices">Simulation, Tools, Deployments and Devices</h3>
<p>The workflow for the deployment of a WSN usually foresees a preliminary
simulation of the proposed solution to assess its performance. In this
context, a key question is the validity of the simulation results. In
[29],[30],[31],[32] we compared the simulation results with the
ones obtained in a real test-bed. The debugging of WSN can be a
labor-intensive and cumbersome task. In [33] we present a tool,
basically a distributed network sniffer alongside the inspected sensor
network. The ability of re-programming over-the-air (OTA) the nodes is
crucial to fix bugs or enhance the functionalities on the nodes.
Usually, OTA assume an always-on network. In [34] we presented a
protocol capable to support OTA in network with a duty-cycle. In our lab
on WSNs we developed the MagoNode [35], an embedded system based on a
highly efficient RF front-end that greatly improves RF performance, in
terms of radio range and sensibility, still limiting energy consumption.
Indeed, the device outperforms other existing amplified platforms
available on the market and is comparable to most commonly known
unamplified motes. A network of cooperating tiny artifacts requires new
programming models [36]. In [37] we explored the novel concept of
virtual sensor networks, namely WSNs capable to adapt their behavior
according to the user needs. the Internet of Underwater Things is
probably the new frontier of WSNs. In [38] we presented the system to
access the SUNRISE federation of facilities to test solutions for the
Internet of Underwater Things. In [39] we started the investigation on
the employment of WSNs to monitor critical infrastructures. This
activity has been further developed in [40] where we presented the
work done to monitor the structural health of a Rome B1 underground
construction site by a WSNs. In [41],[42] a WSN has been used for
noise pollution monitoring.</p>
<h3 id="plant-as-sensors">Plant as sensors</h3>
<p>I have been the coordinator of the EU Future and Emerging Technologies
(FET) project PLEASED. The aim of the project was the development of a
technology capable of exploiting the plants as bio-sensors. In other
words, PLEASED was an attempt to develop a kind interface between plants
and computers, namely a plant-cyborg. Indeed, plants react to some
external stimuli generating an electrical signal that can be captured by
suitable devices (similarly to what happens in EMG). The main problem
here is to develop a technology capable to uniquely identify the applied
stimuli from the observed electrical signals. The idea of using plants
as sensing devices has been first presented in [43]. In
[44],[45],[46],[47] a number of machine learning techniques has
been evaluated to classify the electrical signal generated by plants in
response to heterogeneous stimuli. The main goal of this research was to
identify a fingerprint in those electrical responses capable of
discriminating the applied stimuli; this is indeed the main build block
of a future employment of plants as bio-sensors.</p>
<h2 id="services-to-the-users">Services to the Users</h2>
<h3 id="localization">Localization</h3>
<p>During my stay in AT&amp;T research lab in USA I had the opportunity of
conducting a pioneering experimental activity on Cell-ID location
techniques [48],[49] that also resulted in the application of of
three provisional patents.</p>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<p>We initially considered the issues related to the implementation of
state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives on resource constrained
devices [50], [51] and mobile environments [52] Then we focused on
the development of technical solutions capable to balance the tradeoff
between the privacy of the users and the utility of the offered services
[53], [54], [55], [56]. Current approaches in digital trials
entail that private user data are provisioned to the trial investigator
that is considered a trusted party. The aim of [57] is to present the
technical requirements and the research challenges to secure the flow
and control of personal data and to protect the interests of all the
involved parties during the first phases of a clinical trial, namely the
characterization of the potential patients and their possible
recruitment. The proposed architecture will let the individuals keep
their data private during these phases while providing a useful sketch
of their data to the investigator. More recently, we started a research
activity on blockchain technologies. This activity is focused on two
main directions: a) the development of interesting use-cases to prove
the applicability of such technology beyond the financial domain; in
particular we used blockchain technologies to guarantee the quality of
data in IoT based clinical trials [58] and to support the
democratization of the decision processes in the smart cities [59]),
b) the development of suitable software engineering techniques to reduce
the risks in the development of decentralized applications [60].</p>
<h3 id="recommendation-systems">Recommendation systems</h3>
<p>Searching is probably the main functionality of the Web. In [61] we
performed an experimental study of pre-fetching and caching algorithms
for the world wide web. However, in modern applications recommendation
systems play an equally important role taking advantage of Big Data to
deliver personalized recommendations based on a visitor’s previous
activities and those of other similar customers. Usually recommendation
systems rely on centralized architectures. In [62],[63],[64],
[65] we investigate the effectiveness of fully decentralized,
collaborative filtering techniques. In [56] we propose a decentralized
system capable to recommend new friendships to other users. In our
proposal, the information needed to perform recommendation is collected
and exchanged between users in a privacy preserving way.</p>
<h3 id="other-services">Other services</h3>
<p>The participation to the EU project CHIRON allowed us to understand the
main components of a Next-Generation Remote Healthcare [66]. Also on
the basis of this experience, we developed a simple system to deliver
elder-care environments utilizing TV-channel based mechanisms [67].
The UX is also the main concept explored in [68] where we investigated
an a ubiquitous touch-based remote grocery shopping process.</p>
<p>In [69],[70] we explored the concept of cooperative design supported
by genetic algorithm. The selection of the products that will actually
take part to the evolutionary process, relies on crowdsourcing
mechanisms: only the most appreciated products survive.</p>
