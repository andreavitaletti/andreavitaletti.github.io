Technology Transfer
----------------------

2002-2016

:   In 2002 I founded WLAB, a dynamic SME created to support applied research and prototyping in the area of ​​wireless technologies and pervasive and mobile computing. WLAB has been characterized by the synergy with the universities of Rome (Sapienza and Tor Vergata) promoting a continuous and effective technological transfer of innovative solutions from the academic world to the industry. I was Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of WLAB until its sale in 2016

Since 2012

: In 2012 I founded [WSENSE](www.wsense.it) a spin-off of Sapienza University of Rome, with a strong and experienced R&D team specialized in monitoring and communication systems with pioneering patented solutions in the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT). I am currently the CTO of WSENSE and I lead the activities for the development of the WGATE, the cloud platform for the collection, analysis, visualisation and integration of IoT data. WSENSE is an international company, with [WSENSE Ltd](https://www.wsense.uk/) hosted in the [Marine Robotics Innovation Centre](https://www.noc.ac.uk/tags/create-story-6) di Southampton U.K.

Since 2014

: Among the organizers of the [Google Technologies Workshop for Cloud and Web Development](https://sites.google.com/a/dis.uniroma1.it/google-technologies-for-cloud-and-web-development-2017-2018/) now in its fifth edition. The workshop is aimed at students with the purpose of introducing them to a methodology of application development that is not limited only to technological aspects, but can lead them to the realization of a start-up. The success of the workshop is also measured by the fact that some participants are now hosted in business accelerators


In 2014

: Successful experience in a crowd-funding campaign with the project [COVA](https://www.eppela.com/it/projects/5619- cova-collaboriamo-a-valorizzare-i-monumenti-minori) that has been also boradcasted in the Italian main TV channel  [RAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKwOXz7DKWs&feature=youtu.be)

In 2001 (3 months)

: During his stay at AT&T Research Labs of Florham Park, NJ - USA, his research activity led to the application of four provisional patent applications.  


*   Patent 102003901105392 (RM2003A000177): Procedure for the recognition of authenticity of documents and debt securities, in particular banknotes, and related system.

*   Patent 102001900950099 (RM2001A000492): Method for the secure transmission of data through short message service messages (SMS) with related methods for generating and recognizing secure SMS.


*   The research group of the DIAG on WSN coordinated by Andrea Vitaletti has developed and implemented the MagoNode: a new wireless device for WSN networks operating in the 2.4Ghz ISM band completely developed at DIAG which has been used in many field trials.

## Projects

I have acquired a significant experience on research projects, gained in more than 15 years of participation to academic and industrial projects characterized in many cases by a marked multidisciplinarity approach. Over time he has assumed various roles, with different responsibilities, as researcher, principal investigator (PI) and finally coordinator. The main projects in which he was involved are briefly described below.

-   FP7-PEOPLE-ITN-2008 [FRONTS (PI)](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/85404_en.html), Overall Budget: EUR 3.1 Mln. From 01-02-2008 to 30-04-2011. The aim of this project is to establish the foundations of adaptive networked societies of small or tiny heterogeneous artifacts. I participated to all the review meetings where I presented the activities of WP2. 

-   FP7-ICT-2009-5 [VITRO (PI)](http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/95468_en.html), Overall Budget: EUR 3.4 Mln. From 01-09-2010 to 28-02-2013. This project is focused on developing architectures, algorithms and engineering methods, which will enable the realization of scalable, flexible, adaptive, energy-efficient andtrust-aware Virtual Sensor Network platforms. I participated to all the review meetings where I presented the activities of WP3.

-   ARTEMISI-JU call 2009, [CHIRON (PI)](https://artemis-ia.eu/project/17-chiron.html), Overall Budget: EUR 17.8 Mln. From 01-03-2010 to 01-02-2013. CHIRON intends to combine state-of-the-art technologies and innovative solutions into an integrated framework for effective and person-centric health management throughout the complete (health)care cycle thus responding to the present-day demographic and socio-economic challenges facing healthcare: from an ever ageing population to the need for affordable ‘global’ healthcare provided by fewer and fewer professionals and medical infrastructures for critical, often mobile, patients.

-   EU EUROSTARS-EUREKA, [PharmAID (PI)](https://www.eurostars-eureka.eu/project/id/5067), Overall Budget: EUR 2 Mln. From 01-06-2010 to 31-12-2012. Logistics control, storage monitoring and anti-counterfeiting of PHARMaceutical products by Advanced Integrated Devices. Creating an infrastructure based on passive RFID tags for the pharmaceutical market to: - prevent drugs' counterfeiting; - certify drugs' integrity against unsuitable ambient conditions exposures; and - track drugs along the supply chain. I participated to all the review meetings where I presented the activities of WP5.

-   FP7-ICT-2011-C FET (Future Emerging Technology) OPEN, [PLEASED](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/103686_en.html) (**Coordinator**), Overall Budget: EUR 1.46 Mln. From 01-05-2012 to 30-04-2015. Evaluated  Excellent. In this project, we plan to develop plant cyborgs, shifting focus from interfacing a single plant to a network of entities (a community of plants) that renders an orchestrated response to the environment in which it lives. While artificial sensing devices exist that can monitor environmental parameters of interest, such as temperature or humidity, the focus of our research will be on the use of plants themselves as sensing and decision-making devices. The results of the multidisciplinary team in the project have obtained a significant eco in  he media such as [Youtube](https://youtu.be/2tgdCB3v7mE http://bbc.in/1ow6KSJ) and [Wired](https://www.wired.com/2014/01/internet-plants/).

-   EU FI-ADOPT, [PAGE](https://www.f6s.com/fiware-fiadopt) (**Coordinator**), Overall Budget: EUR 150 K. From 01-11-2014 to  01-11-2015. Evaluated Excellent. A project to develop a technology capable to support elderly in their daily activities.

-   FP7-ICT-2013-10. [SUNRISE](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/110326_en.html) (I). Overall Budget: EUR 5.3 Mln. From 2013-09-01 to 2016-12-31. The SUNRISE objectives are to develop a federated underwater communication networks, based on pilot infrastructure already designed, built and deployed by consortium partners, in diverse environments, web-accessible and interfaced with existing FIRE facilities to experiment with Future Internet technologies.

-   EASME [ARCHEOSUb](http://www.archeosub.eu/index.php/en/) (I) . The ARCHEOSUb (Autonomous underwater Robotic and sensing systems for Cultural Heritage discovery Conservation and in situ valorization) project aims to develop products and services in support of the discovery of new Underwater Cultural Heritage (UCH) sites and of the surveying, conservation, protection, and valorization of new and existing ones.
