<p><strong>Other earlier project activities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I was the technical manager of the DIAG group in Rome “La Sapienza” for the project VICOM (Virtual Immersive COMmunications - http://www.vicom-project.it/). The project has developed the infrastructure for the provisioning of augmented realty mobile services. In particular, the group of Rome has developed the framework for the location of mobile users through heterogeneous technologies (GPS, CellID, WiFi, Sensor Networks …)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was the coordinator and technical manager of the CINI lab in Rome. The lab participated in the FIRB project WEB, developing a framework for the remote access to multimedia context sensitive services (eg: tourist guides on mobile phones where the information is georeferenced).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I collaborated with the group of Professor Chiara Petrioli within the European project EYES (Energy Efficient Sensor networks - http://www.eyes.eu.org/) for the creation of energy-efficient self-organizing sensor networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I collaborated with the group of Professor Chiara Petrioli in the EU project WiSeNts (Wireless Sensor Networks and Cooperating Smart Objects). The project studied the main dynamics for the realization of complex systems of intelligent and cooperating objects (e.g. sensor networks). As part of this project I visited the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETHZ) in 2006.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was a researcher in the European project AEOLUS (Algorithmic Principles for Building Efficient Overlay Computers - http://dmod.cs.uoi.gr/aeolus site / main.htm). The project investigated methods and algorithms for creating overlay networks for the efficient and transparent access to Internet resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was a researcher in the European project DELIS (Dynamically Evolving, Large-scale Information Systems - http://delis.upb.de/). The project has developed methods, techniques and tools to effectively manage modern information systems, characterized by large and extremely dynamic information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the EU SOFIA project (Artemisia - https://www.artemisia-association.org/sofia), I was task leader for TASK3.3 in WP3. The SOFIA project has created a platform for interoperability between embedded systems in smart environments.                                                                                                                                                                             |</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>The following figure shows the <a href="https://www.wordclouds.com/">Wordcloud</a> of the abstracts of my papers downloaded from <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=6506463530">Scopus</a> and I think well capture the evolution of my research interests.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/images/wordcloud.jpg" /></p>
<p>I initially focused on wireless networks for the collection of data to provide useful services to the users. This activity, is nowadays part of the wider research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and more recently naturally brought me to start an investigation on Decentralized Applications and Blockchain Technologies.</p>
<p>A distinctive characteristics of my research is the attempt to always validate the performance of the proposed solutions, namely algorithms and protocols, both theoretically and practically.</p>
<p>I lead the research activities on wireless sensor networks and the Internet of Things, in the research group on Computer Networks and Pervasive Systems of the Department of Automatic Computer Engineering and Management Antonio Ruberti della Sapienza University of Rome (DIAG). In this context, I enjoied the cooperation with several international research organizations, including: Research Academic Computer Technology Institute (Greece), Braunschweig University of Technology (Germany), Universitat Paderborn (Germany), University of Athens (Greece), Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (Israel), University of Salerno (Italy), Wroclaw University of Technology (Poland), Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (Spain), University of Geneva (Switzerland), University of Lubeck (Germany).</p>
<p>I founded the laboratory on the wireless sensor network at DIAG where the solutions - both hardware and software - designed in the our research activities, are implemented and tested in the field. In the lab, we developed and implemented the MagoNode: a new wireless device for WSN networks operating in the 2.4Ghz ISM band deployed in many field trials.</p>
<p>I enjoy a long term collaboration on cooperative design and co-design with faculties of the MSc in Product Design at Sapienza. In particular, I’m leading the research activities on the employment of genetic algorithms for product design.</p>

<p>I used the technique described <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/nechbamohammed/abstract-clustering-for-scientific-paper-insights">here</a> to  cluster my papers based on their abstracts. The result is shown in the following picture</p>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/images/topics_clustering.png" /></p>
<p>I think this approach provides good results that well reflects my research over time. Papers are classified according to the opics  as shown in the following picture</p>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/images/papers_topics.png" /></p>
<p>The interactive graphs produced by the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XGpF8d5WoR2sOFMits1Y5TkaImMOstPy?usp=sharing">Colab notebook</a> used to obtain these results is available <a href="assets/Abstract_Analysis.html">here</a></p>
