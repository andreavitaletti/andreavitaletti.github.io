<p>I have acquired a significant experience on research projects, gained in more than 15 years of participation to academic and industrial projects characterized in many cases by a marked multidisciplinarity approach. Over time he has assumed various roles, with different responsibilities, as researcher, principal investigator (PI) and finally coordinator. The main projects in which he was involved are briefly described below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>FP7-PEOPLE-ITN-2008 <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/85404_en.html">FRONTS (PI)</a>, Overall Budget: EUR 3.1 Mln. From 01-02-2008 to 30-04-2011. The aim of this project is to establish the foundations of adaptive networked societies of small or tiny heterogeneous artifacts. I participated to all the review meetings where I presented the activities of WP2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FP7-ICT-2009-5 <a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/95468_en.html">VITRO (PI)</a>, Overall Budget: EUR 3.4 Mln. From 01-09-2010 to 28-02-2013. This project is focused on developing architectures, algorithms and engineering methods, which will enable the realization of scalable, flexible, adaptive, energy-efficient andtrust-aware Virtual Sensor Network platforms. I participated to all the review meetings where I presented the activities of WP3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ARTEMISI-JU call 2009, <a href="https://artemis-ia.eu/project/17-chiron.html">CHIRON (PI)</a>, Overall Budget: EUR 17.8 Mln. From 01-03-2010 to 01-02-2013. CHIRON intends to combine state-of-the-art technologies and innovative solutions into an integrated framework for effective and person-centric health management throughout the complete (health)care cycle thus responding to the present-day demographic and socio-economic challenges facing healthcare: from an ever ageing population to the need for affordable ‘global’ healthcare provided by fewer and fewer professionals and medical infrastructures for critical, often mobile, patients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EU EUROSTARS-EUREKA, <a href="https://www.eurostars-eureka.eu/project/id/5067">PharmAID (PI)</a>, Overall Budget: EUR 2 Mln. From 01-06-2010 to 31-12-2012. Logistics control, storage monitoring and anti-counterfeiting of PHARMaceutical products by Advanced Integrated Devices. Creating an infrastructure based on passive RFID tags for the pharmaceutical market to: - prevent drugs&rsquo; counterfeiting; - certify drugs&rsquo; integrity against unsuitable ambient conditions exposures; and - track drugs along the supply chain. I participated to all the review meetings where I presented the activities of WP5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FP7-ICT-2011-C FET (Future Emerging Technology) OPEN, <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/103686_en.html">PLEASED</a> (<strong>Coordinator</strong>), Overall Budget: EUR 1.46 Mln. From 01-05-2012 to 30-04-2015. Evaluated  Excellent. In this project, we plan to develop plant cyborgs, shifting focus from interfacing a single plant to a network of entities (a community of plants) that renders an orchestrated response to the environment in which it lives. While artificial sensing devices exist that can monitor environmental parameters of interest, such as temperature or humidity, the focus of our research will be on the use of plants themselves as sensing and decision-making devices. The results of the multidisciplinary team in the project have obtained a significant eco in  he media such as [Youtube](<a href="https://youtu.be/2tgdCB3v7mE">https://youtu.be/2tgdCB3v7mE</a> <a href="http://bbc.in/1ow6KSJ">http://bbc.in/1ow6KSJ</a>) and <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/01/internet-plants/">Wired</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EU FI-ADOPT, <a href="https://www.f6s.com/fiware-fiadopt">PAGE</a> (<strong>Coordinator</strong>), Overall Budget: EUR 150 K. From 01-11-2014 to  01-11-2015. Evaluated Excellent. A project to develop a technology capable to support elderly in their daily activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FP7-ICT-2013-10. <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/110326_en.html">SUNRISE</a> (I). Overall Budget: EUR 5.3 Mln. From 2013-09-01 to 2016-12-31. The SUNRISE objectives are to develop a federated underwater communication networks, based on pilot infrastructure already designed, built and deployed by consortium partners, in diverse environments, web-accessible and interfaced with existing FIRE facilities to experiment with Future Internet technologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EASME <a href="http://www.archeosub.eu/index.php/en/">ARCHEOSUb</a> (I) . The ARCHEOSUb (Autonomous underwater Robotic and sensing systems for Cultural Heritage discovery Conservation and in situ valorization) project aims to develop products and services in support of the discovery of new Underwater Cultural Heritage (UCH) sites and of the surveying, conservation, protection, and valorization of new and existing ones.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In  the following I briefly outline some of the activities performed before</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>He has been the technical manager of the DIAG group in Rome &ldquo;La Sapienza&rdquo; for the project VICOM (Virtual Immersive COMmunications - <a href="http://www.vicom-project.it/)">http://www.vicom-project.it/)</a>. The project has developed the infrastructure for the provisioning of augmented realty mobile services. In particular, the group of Rome has developed the  framework for the location of mobile users through heterogeneous technologies (GPS, CellID, WiFi, Sensor Networks &hellip;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was the coordinator and technical manager of the CINI lab in Rome. The lab participated in the FIRB project WEB developing a framework for the remote access to multimedia context sensitive services (eg: tourist guides on mobile phones where the information is georeferenced).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He collaborated with the group of Professor Chiara Petrioli within the European project EYES (Energy Efficient Sensor networks - <a href="http://www.eyes.eu.org/">http://www.eyes.eu.org/</a>) for the creation of sensor networks that self-organize and collaborate to the realization of a system energetically efficient. In particular, it has been studied how the emplyment of sparsifying techniques of the connectivity graph can lead to a significant reduction in energy consumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He collaborated with the group of Professor Chiara Petrioli as part of the European project WiSeNts (Wireless Sensor Networks and Cooperating Smart Objects). The project studied the dynamics of the processes that underlie the realization of complex systems of intelligent and cooperating objects (eg sensor networks). As part of this project he visited the ETHZ (see \ [visit ])</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has participated in the European project AEOLUS (Algorithmic Principles for Building Efficient Overlay Computers - <a href="http://dmod.cs.uoi.gr/aeolus">http://dmod.cs.uoi.gr/aeolus</a> site / main.htm) as a researcher. The project investigated methods and algorithms for creating overlay networks for the efficient and transparent access to Internet resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He participated in the European project DELIS (Dynamically Evolving, Large-scale Information Systems - <a href="http://delis.upb.de/">http://delis.upb.de/</a>) as a researcher. The project has developed methods, techniques and tools to effectively manage modern information systems, characterized by large and extremely dynamic information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the EU SOFIA project (Artemisia - <a href="https://www.artemisia-association.org/sofia),">https://www.artemisia-association.org/sofia),</a> he was responsible for TASK3.3 under WP3. The SOFIA project has created a platform for interoperability between embedded systems that participate in the creation of a smart environment</p>
</li>
</ul>
