## Research

<img class="three" src="{{ '/assets/img/WC.png' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">

The figure above shows the [Wordcloud](https://www.wordclouds.com/) of
the abstracts of my papers. After a stemming process, the 50 most
frequent terms in the abstracts are shown with a size that is
proportional to their frequence.

The most evident terms (i.e. the biggest, namely the more frequent in
the abstract) can be grouped in three main groups:

-   network, wireless, protocol
-   data, perform, result
-   user

To some extent, this grouping well summarize my research activity that
focus on *protocols* and systems for *wireless networks* capable to
collect *data* to a) provide useful services for the users and b)
*validate* the *performance* of our results.

Furthermore, a distinctive chracrteristics of my research is the attempt
to always validate the performance of the proposed solutions, both
theoretical and practical, via simulations and real testbeds.
