The focus here is on the Application Layer of the Internet Protocol Suite, so we assume that the reader is familiar with the main concepts of the link, network and transport layers.\nNotice that we do not want to re-invent the wheel, so whenever possible we will use material on the Internet and we\u0026rsquo;ll try to promptly credit it. If we are missing some credit, please let us know.\nSockets The first step to build a network application is the ability to establish a communication between two nodes. The endpoints of such communications are sockets and are used\n for sending or receiving data at a single node in a computer network wikipedia.\n Sockets allow us to send and receive data over TCP, while DatagramSockets are employed for UDP.\nHTTP Once we know how to send and receive data we need a protocol, namely a set of rules and conventions to structure the communication between the nodes. Indeed, it is not sufficient for the initiator to send the data, such data have to be understood by the responder. Similarly, the initiator needs to understand the possible answer provided by the responder. This is roughly the purpose of a protocol, namely the specification of the interactions between the communicating entities.\nAmong the protocols at application layer, we will focus on HTTP, the main protocol for the World Wide Web. This is a classical example of a Client/Server. The Client initiate the communication requesting a service to the Server that reply granting/denying access to the requested service. In HTTP the requested service is usually related to the management of a resource identified by an URL. As an example, when you write http://www.gihub.com in your browser (i.e. the HTTP Client), you are requesting to GET the default web page (i.e. the resource) in the github server.\nApplication Server Now that we now how to properly communicate with the HTTP protocol, we need a server capable to elaborate \u0026ldquo;complex\u0026rdquo; replies to HTTP requests, possibly interacting with local or remote resource. The tool in charge of elaborating such replies is the Application Server.\nREST Putting together stuff on the Internet can be extremely complex. How to properly describe what a resource is and does?\nRepresentational state transfer (REST) or RESTful web services are a way of providing interoperability between computer systems on the Internet via HTTP. REST-compliant Web services allow requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations.\nAuthentication and Authorization REST is a convenient way to access resources over the Internet, but a fundamental question arises: who should be able to access?\nOAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.\nWeb Sockets The HTML5 WebSockets specification defines an API that enables web pages to use the WebSockets protocol for two-way communication with a remote host. It introduces the WebSocket interface and defines a full-duplex communication channel that operates through a single socket over the Web.\nMessaging HTTP is inherently synchronous: the client make a request and waits for the answer. In many cases, we need asynchronous communications, and this is exactly the purpose of AMQP. The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware.\nMicroservices Essentially, microservice architecture is a method of developing software applications as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services in which each service runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal.\nPaaS In the past, networking service required the deployment of complex network infrastructure at home\nNowadays, the deployment of complex mash-up network services has been facilitated by the Platform as a Service (PaaS) concept. PaaS is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.\nIoT In the recent years, the miniaturization and reduction of HW costs (Moore\u0026rsquo;s law) and the ability of supporting million or even billions of connected devices have pushed the Internet of things (IoT). IoT is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to connect and exchange data. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to inter-operate within the existing Internet infrastructure.\nData streaming The IoT vision implies the generation of of an incredible amount of data (i.e. Big Data) characterized by unprecedented volumes, variety and velocity. Contrary to messages, that have a well defined start and end, data streaming is a continuous flow of data that has to be managed on the fly.\nBeyond Client Server Up to now, we considered Client Server architecture. However, there are a number of other options. Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes. Peers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts.[1] Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional client-server model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided.\n"});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/docs/Teaching/Reti-di-Calcolatori/Application-Server/','title':"Application Server",'content':"In the section on HTTP, we have mainly seen how to access static resources, but we have also had a look to dynamic pages generated in PHP.\nIn this section we will go further on the generation of dynamic content by anApplication Server (AS). While a Web server is designed to manage static resources (e.g. Web pages), the AS allow us to generate Web pages on the fly according to a specific business logic.\nAs an example, consider a Web page showing the content of an information system (e.g. a timetable). As soon as the timetable changes, the corresponding Web page has to change.\nThis is possible, because the AS, when responding to an http request for the timetable, first access the information system to get fresh information, and then presents this information in a suitable format (e.g. HTML). To implement such logic, the AS exploits a specific language. There are thousands of solutions for server side scripting.\nWe will focus on Nodejs\n"});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/docs/Teaching/Reti-di-Calcolatori/Authentication-and-Authorization/','title':"Authentication and Authorization",'content':"In many cases, resources can be accessed only to authenticated users.

As an example, if you want to develop a solution in which a client want to know when a door is open, the client cannot know in advance when to place the request. In these cases, you have basically 2 options: 1) polling, namely continuously query the server in the hope to intercept the interesting event, 2) relay on a completely different protocol based on messages.\nMessages are inherently asynchronous.

A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to. An endpoint is a combination of an IP address and a port number. Every TCP connection can be uniquely identified by its two endpoints. That way you can have multiple connections between your host and the server.\n We explore sockets implementing the HTTP protocol using the JAVA language.\nAs already observed, a protocol is a controlled sequence of messages that is exchanged between two or more systems to accomplish a given task.\nProtocol specifications define this sequence together with the format or layout of the messages that are exchanged\nIn HTTP a client makes a request, characterized by a method, as depicted in the following figures.\nThe server responds to the request specifying the nature of the response with a status code.\nExperiments As a Web server we use NGINX, a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server.\nIn most of the experiments, we will setup a convenient experimental environment employing docker see [[Tools]] for further details\nNGINX sul Docker Hub\ndocker run --name ngix4RC -d nginx\ndocker ps lists all the running images\nThe code for this part is available here\nNote that the service is running but cannot be accessed from the host. The following script allows us to map the folder in the host machine /home/andrea/Documents/University/... into the folder in the container /usr/share/nginx/html and to map the port 80 in the container to the port 8080 of the host.\ndocker run --name ngix4RC -p 8080:80 -v '/home/andrea/Documents/University/Didattica/RC2018/docker/1. Simple Web Server/some/content':/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -d nginx Now if put in your browser the localhost:8080 you can finally access the content in /usr/share/nginx/html.\nIf you need a shell to open a shell in the container, get the container id by docker ps and then\nsudo docker exec -i -t \u0026lt;container_id\u0026gt; /bin/bash\nFinally, it can be convenient to build new images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile\ndocker build -t some-content-nginx .\nThen you can run the corresponding container by\ndocker run --name some-nginx -d -p 8080:80 some-content-nginx\nIt is now time to inspect the underlying HTTP flow. To this purpose we will use the protocol analyser Wireshark. Remember to filter only http traffic and enjoy.\nThis tool allows you to inspect at all levels the interaction between the client and the server. Up to know we used \u0026ldquo;commercial\u0026rdquo; software, now we aim at implementing our PoC (Proof-of-Concept)of the client and the server. Please note that even if those are only PoC they can effectively interact with \u0026ldquo;commercial\u0026rdquo; softwares. Why? Simple, they correctly implement a minimal set of HTTP commands.\nOur HTTP-client PoC (i.e. a browser) \u0026hellip; it works with NGINX import java.io.*; import java.net.*; public class SocketSimpleWebBrowser { public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { Socket echoSocket = null; PrintWriter out = null; BufferedReader in = null; try { echoSocket = new Socket(\u0026#34;localhost\u0026#34;, 8080); out = new PrintWriter( echoSocket.getOutputStream(), true); in = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader( echoSocket.getInputStream())); } catch (UnknownHostException e) { System.err.println(\u0026#34;Don\u0026#39;t know about the host\u0026#34;); System.exit(1); } catch (IOException e) { System.err.println(\u0026#34;Couldn\u0026#39;t get I/O for this connection.\u0026#34;); System.exit(1); } out.println(\u0026#34;GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\\r\u0026#34;); out.println(\u0026#34;Host: localhost\\r\u0026#34;); out.println(\u0026#34;User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 6.0; Nexus 5 Build/MRA58N) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/59.0.3071.115 Mobile Safari/537.36\\r\u0026#34;); out.println(\u0026#34;\\r\u0026#34;); String data; while ((data = in.readLine()) != null) { System.out.println(data); } out.close(); in.close(); echoSocket.close(); } } Our HTTP-server PoC (i.e. a web server) \u0026hellip; it works with Chrome With a little effort let\u0026rsquo;s make it multi thread\u0026hellip;\nimport java.net.*; import java.io.*; public class SimpleWebServer { public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { ServerSocket serverSocket = null; try { serverSocket = new ServerSocket(4444); } catch (IOException e) { System.err.println(\u0026#34;Could not listen on port: 4444.\u0026#34;); System.exit(1); } Socket clientSocket = null; try { clientSocket = serverSocket.accept(); } catch (IOException e) { System.err.println(\u0026#34;Accept failed.\u0026#34;); System.exit(1); } PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true); BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader( clientSocket.getInputStream())); String inputLine; while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) { // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4758525/carriage-return-and-new-line-with-java-and-readline \tif (inputLine.length() == 0) break; System.out.println(inputLine); } String message = new String(args[0]); out.println(\u0026#34;HTTP/1.1 200 ok\\r\\n\u0026#34;); out.println(\u0026#34;\u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \\r\\n\u0026#34;); out.println(\u0026#34;\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \\r\\n\u0026#34;); out.println(\u0026#34;\u0026lt;title\u0026gt; index \u0026lt;/title\u0026gt;\\r\\n\u0026#34;); out.println(\u0026#34;\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \\r\\n\u0026#34;); out.println(\u0026#34;\u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \\r\\n\u0026#34;); out.println(\u0026#34;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;\u0026#34;+message+\u0026#34;\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \\r\\n\u0026#34;); out.println(\u0026#34;\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \\r\\n\u0026#34;); out.println(\u0026#34;\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; \\r\\n\u0026#34;); out.close(); in.close(); clientSocket.close(); serverSocket.close(); } } Handling the POST In order to handle a POST in an interesting scenario we need an application server [[Application-Server]]\n Docker creates isolated machine (container). Each container contains only one process (Apache or Mysql or another); And Dockerfile defines how to build a image. Docker compose allows run, links and configure the bunch of containers together. ref\n We will use the following docker.compose.yml\nversion: \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; services: node1: image: \u0026quot;node:8\u0026quot; user: \u0026quot;node\u0026quot; working_dir: /home/node/app environment: - NODE_ENV=production volumes: - /home/andrea/Documents/University/Didattica/RC2018/docker/2.Node:/home/node/app ports: - \u0026quot;8081:8081\u0026quot; expose: - 8081 command: \u0026quot;npm start\u0026quot; node2: image: \u0026quot;node:8\u0026quot; user: \u0026quot;node\u0026quot; working_dir: /home/node/app environment: - NODE_ENV=production volumes: - /home/andrea/Documents/University/Didattica/RC2018/docker/2.Node:/home/node/app ports: - \u0026quot;8082:8081\u0026quot; expose: - 8081 command: \u0026quot;npm start\u0026quot; To run the container simply digit docker-compose up\nand you will run the following server on port 8081 and 8082 of localhost both mapped into port 8081 on the containers.\nvar http = require(\u0026#39;http\u0026#39;); var fs = require(\u0026#39;fs\u0026#39;); var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) { if (req.method === \u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;) { res.writeHead(200, { \u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;text/html\u0026#34; }); fs.createReadStream(\u0026#34;form.html\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;).pipe(res); } else if (req.method === \u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;) { var body = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; req.on(\u0026#34;data\u0026#34;, function (chunk) { body += chunk; }); req.on(\u0026#34;end\u0026#34;, function(){ res.writeHead(200, { \u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;text/html\u0026#34; }); res.end(body); }); } }).listen(8081); As you can image the else statement manages POST requests.

After a stemming process, the 50 most frequent terms in the abstracts are shown with a size that is proportional to their frequency.\nThe most evident terms (i.e. the biggest, namely the more frequent in the abstract) well summarize my research that focus on wireless networks for the collection of data to provide useful services to the users. This activity, is nowadays part of the wider research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and more recently naturally brought me to start an investigation on Decentralized Applications and Blockchain Technologies.\nA distinctive characteristics of my research is the attempt to always validate the performance of the proposed solutions, both theoretical and practical, via simulations and real testbeds.\nI lead the research activities on wireless sensor networks and the Internet of Things, in the research group on Computer Networks and Pervasive Systems of the Department of Automatic Computer Engineering and Management Antonio Ruberti della Sapienza University of Rome (DIAG). In this context, I enjoied the cooperation with several international research organizations, including: Research Academic Computer Technology Institute (Greece), Braunschweig University of Technology (Germany), Universitat Paderborn (Germany), University of Athens (Greece), Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (Israel), University of Salerno (Italy), Wroclaw University of Technology (Poland), Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (Spain), University of Geneva (Switzerland), University of Lubeck (Germany).\nI founded the laboratory on the wireless sensor network of DIAG where the solutions - both hardware and software - designed in the our research activities, are implemented and tested in the field.\nI enjoy a long term collaboration on cooperative design and co-design with faculties of the MSc in Product Design at Sapienza. In particular, I’m leading the research activities on the employment of genetic algorithms for product design.\nWireless Networks for the Collection of Data Allocation Problems Coloring algorithms can be used to model bandwidth allocation problems in FDMA systems. In [1] we present randomized lower bounds for online coloring of some well studied network topologies. Wireless data networks allow multiple codes (or channels) to be allocated to a single user, where each code can support multiple data rates. Providing fine-grained QoS to users in such networks poses the two-dimensional challenge of assigning both power (rate) and codes to every user [2],[3]. A similar “two-dimensional challenge” emerges in the allocation of bandwidth slots to communication requests on a satellite channel under real time constraints. Accepted requests must be scheduled on non-intersecting rectangles in the time/bandwidth Cartesian space with the goal of maximizing the benefit obtained from accepted requests. [4]\nData collection and energy consumption Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are made of battery powered nodes, consequently the energy consumption of the nodes must be optimized to increase the network life-time. WSN are deployed to monitor a phenomenon and in a very simplistic setting we can identify two main phases: a) the interest dissemination, where the nodes are notified on the phenomenon they have to observe, and b) the data collection where the nodes report the observed data. In [5],[6] we tackle the problem of designing simple, localized, low energy consuming, reliable protocols for one-to-all communication (namely the main paradigm for interest-dissemination) in large scale wireless sensor networks. Data aggregation can be used to combine data of several sensors into a single message, thus reducing sensor communication costs during the data collection phase, at the expense of message delays. Thus, the main problem of data aggregation is to balance the communication and delay costs [7],[8],[9],[10]. In [11], [12], [13] we presented solutions capable to integrate the data delivery and interest dissemination techniques. Duty cycling is a useful technique that alternates active and inactive periods to reduce the power consumption. In [14] we presented a protocol capable to automatically adapt the duty-cycle to the application needs. The protocol has been also tested to extend TETRA, a European standard for a trunked radio system, with WSNs [15].\nDelay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) exploit user mobility to deliver messages. In [16],[17],[18],[19],[20],][21] we propose a a reference architecture and a thorough quantitative evaluation of routing protocols for DTNs. Population protocols are used as a theoretical model for a collection (or population) of tiny mobile agents that interact with one another to carry out a computation. In [22] we evaluate the performance of population protocols on real face-to-face social networks of mobile users [25]. In [26] we studied how to exploit the energy scavenged by the pedestrian movements to enhance the operation time of the sensors. In [27],[28] we studied how to enhance the capabilities of multi-robot surveillance with WSNs.\nSimulation, Tools, Deployments and Devices The workflow for the deployment of a WSN usually foresees a preliminary simulation of the proposed solution to assess its performance. In this context, a key question is the validity of the simulation results. In [29],[30],[31],[32] we compared the simulation results with the ones obtained in a real test-bed. The debugging of WSN can be a labor-intensive and cumbersome task. In [33] we present a tool, basically a distributed network sniffer alongside the inspected sensor network. The ability of re-programming over-the-air (OTA) the nodes is crucial to fix bugs or enhance the functionalities on the nodes. Usually, OTA assume an always-on network. In [34] we presented a protocol capable to support OTA in network with a duty-cycle. In our lab on WSNs we developed the MagoNode [35], an embedded system based on a highly efficient RF front-end that greatly improves RF performance, in terms of radio range and sensibility, still limiting energy consumption. Indeed, the device outperforms other existing amplified platforms available on the market and is comparable to most commonly known unamplified motes. A network of cooperating tiny artifacts requires new programming models [36]. In [37] we explored the novel concept of virtual sensor networks, namely WSNs capable to adapt their behavior according to the user needs. the Internet of Underwater Things is probably the new frontier of WSNs. In [38] we presented the system to access the SUNRISE federation of facilities to test solutions for the Internet of Underwater Things. In [39] we started the investigation on the employment of WSNs to monitor critical infrastructures. This activity has been further developed in [40] where we presented the work done to monitor the structural health of a Rome B1 underground construction site by a WSNs. In [41],[42] a WSN has been used for noise pollution monitoring.\nPlant as sensors I have been the coordinator of the EU Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) project PLEASED. The aim of the project was the development of a technology capable of exploiting the plants as bio-sensors. In other words, PLEASED was an attempt to develop a kind interface between plants and computers, namely a plant-cyborg. Indeed, plants react to some external stimuli generating an electrical signal that can be captured by suitable devices (similarly to what happens in EMG). The main problem here is to develop a technology capable to uniquely identify the applied stimuli from the observed electrical signals. The idea of using plants as sensing devices has been first presented in [43]. In [44],[45],[46],[47] a number of machine learning techniques has been evaluated to classify the electrical signal generated by plants in response to heterogeneous stimuli. The main goal of this research was to identify a fingerprint in those electrical responses capable of discriminating the applied stimuli; this is indeed the main build block of a future employment of plants as bio-sensors.\nServices to the Users Localization During my stay in AT\u0026amp;T research lab in USA I had the opportunity of conducting a pioneering experimental activity on Cell-ID location techniques [48],[49] that also resulted in the application of of three provisional patents.\nPrivacy We initially considered the issues related to the implementation of state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives on resource constrained devices [50], [51] and mobile environments [52] Then we focused on the development of technical solutions capable to balance the tradeoff between the privacy of the users and the utility of the offered services [53], [54], [55], [56]. Current approaches in digital trials entail that private user data are provisioned to the trial investigator that is considered a trusted party. The aim of [57] is to present the technical requirements and the research challenges to secure the flow and control of personal data and to protect the interests of all the involved parties during the first phases of a clinical trial, namely the characterization of the potential patients and their possible recruitment. The proposed architecture will let the individuals keep their data private during these phases while providing a useful sketch of their data to the investigator. More recently, we started a research activity on blockchain technologies. This activity is focused on two main directions: a) the development of interesting use-cases to prove the applicability of such technology beyond the financial domain; in particular we used blockchain technologies to guarantee the quality of data in IoT based clinical trials [58] and to support the democratization of the decision processes in the smart cities [59]), b) the development of suitable software engineering techniques to reduce the risks in the development of decentralized applications [60].\nRecommendation systems Searching is probably the main functionality of the Web. In [61] we performed an experimental study of pre-fetching and caching algorithms for the world wide web. However, in modern applications recommendation systems play an equally important role taking advantage of Big Data to deliver personalized recommendations based on a visitor’s previous activities and those of other similar customers. Usually recommendation systems rely on centralized architectures. In [62],[63],[64], [65] we investigate the effectiveness of fully decentralized, collaborative filtering techniques. In [56] we propose a decentralized system capable to recommend new friendships to other users. In our proposal, the information needed to perform recommendation is collected and exchanged between users in a privacy preserving way.\nOther services The participation to the EU project CHIRON allowed us to understand the main components of a Next-Generation Remote Healthcare [66]. Also on the basis of this experience, we developed a simple system to deliver elder-care environments utilizing TV-channel based mechanisms [67]. The UX is also the main concept explored in [68] where we investigated an a ubiquitous touch-based remote grocery shopping process.\nIn [69],[70] we explored the concept of cooperative design supported by genetic algorithm. The selection of the products that will actually take part to the evolutionary process, relies on crowdsourcing mechanisms: only the most appreciated products survive.\nBibliography A likely more recent list of my publications can be found in:\n Google Scolar Scopus DBLP  [1] S.
