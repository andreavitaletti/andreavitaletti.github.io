I am currently Associate professor @ Sapienza University of Rome. My research interests are focused on devising solutions where data are collected, analyzed, managed and valorized in distributed networks fostering a decentralized governance. In this context, I worked over time on IoT, Distributed Ledger Technologies, Federated Machine Learning and Verifiable Computation and I am currently teaching most of these topics @ Sapienza. I am particularly interested in exploring and  studying tradeoffs between data utility and privacy as well as between individual interests and collective ones. I co-authored more than 80 papers I have been involved in a number of EU projects as researcher, principal investigator and coordinator of the FET Open PLEASED.

Several concrete scenarios, including selling images over the Internet, fighting misinformation and detecting deep fakes, would highly benefit from a system allowing to efficiently prove and verify the authenticity of a transformed image (i.e., the public image is a result of a faithful transformation over a private and authentic original image). We have designed a system allowing the possessor of a signed private image to compute a faithful transformation, guaranteeing 1) confidentiality (no leak), 2) efficient proof generation (the proof can be computed with a cheap laptop), 3) integrity (only the advertised transformations have been applied) and 4) efficient fraud detection (fast detection of bogus proofs). Our system is based on a divide-et-impera approach through sub-transformations applied to tiles of the original image that are then reconnected together along with their sub-proofs.
