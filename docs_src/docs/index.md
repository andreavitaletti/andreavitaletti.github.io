## Research

The following figure shows the [Wordcloud](https://www.wordclouds.com/) of the abstracts of my papers downloaded from [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=6506463530) and I think well capture the evolution of my research interests.

![](assets/images/wordcloud.jpg)


I initially focused on wireless networks for the collection of data to provide useful services to the users. This activity, is nowadays part of the wider research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and more recently naturally brought me to start an investigation on Decentralized Applications and Blockchain Technologies.

A distinctive characteristics of my research is the attempt to always validate the performance of the proposed solutions, namely algorithms and protocols, both theoretically and practically.

I lead the research activities on wireless sensor networks and the Internet of Things, in the research group on Computer Networks and Pervasive Systems of the Department of Automatic Computer Engineering and Management Antonio Ruberti della Sapienza University of Rome (DIAG). In this context, I enjoied the cooperation with several international research organizations, including: Research Academic Computer Technology Institute (Greece), Braunschweig University of Technology (Germany), Universitat Paderborn (Germany), University of Athens (Greece), Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (Israel), University of Salerno (Italy), Wroclaw University of Technology (Poland), Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (Spain), University of Geneva (Switzerland), University of Lubeck (Germany).

I founded the laboratory on the wireless sensor network at DIAG where the solutions - both hardware and software - designed in the our research activities, are implemented and tested in the field. In the lab, we developed and implemented the MagoNode: a new wireless device for WSN networks operating in the 2.4Ghz ISM band deployed in many field trials.

I enjoy a long term collaboration on cooperative design and co-design with faculties of the MSc in Product Design at Sapienza. In particular, I’m leading the research activities on the employment of genetic algorithms for product design.
