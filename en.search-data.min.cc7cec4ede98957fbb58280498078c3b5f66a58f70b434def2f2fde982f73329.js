After a stemming process, the 50 most frequent terms in the abstracts are shown with a size that is proportional to their frequency.\nThe most evident terms (i.e. the biggest, namely the more frequent in the abstract) well summarize my research that focus on wireless networks for the collection of data to provide useful services to the users. This activity, is nowadays part of the wider research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and more recently naturally brought me to start an investigation on Decentralized Applications and Blockchain Technologies.\nA distinctive characteristics of my research is the attempt to always validate the performance of the proposed solutions, both theoretical and practical, via simulations and real testbeds.\nI lead the research activities on wireless sensor networks and the Internet of Things, in the research group on Computer Networks and Pervasive Systems of the Department of Automatic Computer Engineering and Management Antonio Ruberti della Sapienza University of Rome (DIAG). In this context, I enjoied the cooperation with several international research organizations, including: Research Academic Computer Technology Institute (Greece), Braunschweig University of Technology (Germany), Universitat Paderborn (Germany), University of Athens (Greece), Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (Israel), University of Salerno (Italy), Wroclaw University of Technology (Poland), Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (Spain), University of Geneva (Switzerland), University of Lubeck (Germany).\nI founded the laboratory on the wireless sensor network of DIAG where the solutions - both hardware and software - designed in the our research activities, are implemented and tested in the field.\nI enjoy a long term collaboration on cooperative design and co-design with faculties of the MSc in Product Design at Sapienza. In particular, I’m leading the research activities on the employment of genetic algorithms for product design.\nWireless Networks for the Collection of Data Allocation Problems Coloring algorithms can be used to model bandwidth allocation problems in FDMA systems. In [1] we present randomized lower bounds for online coloring of some well studied network topologies. Wireless data networks allow multiple codes (or channels) to be allocated to a single user, where each code can support multiple data rates. Providing fine-grained QoS to users in such networks poses the two-dimensional challenge of assigning both power (rate) and codes to every user [2],[3]. A similar “two-dimensional challenge” emerges in the allocation of bandwidth slots to communication requests on a satellite channel under real time constraints. Accepted requests must be scheduled on non-intersecting rectangles in the time/bandwidth Cartesian space with the goal of maximizing the benefit obtained from accepted requests. [4]\nData collection and energy consumption Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are made of battery powered nodes, consequently the energy consumption of the nodes must be optimized to increase the network life-time. WSN are deployed to monitor a phenomenon and in a very simplistic setting we can identify two main phases: a) the interest dissemination, where the nodes are notified on the phenomenon they have to observe, and b) the data collection where the nodes report the observed data. In [5],[6] we tackle the problem of designing simple, localized, low energy consuming, reliable protocols for one-to-all communication (namely the main paradigm for interest-dissemination) in large scale wireless sensor networks. Data aggregation can be used to combine data of several sensors into a single message, thus reducing sensor communication costs during the data collection phase, at the expense of message delays. Thus, the main problem of data aggregation is to balance the communication and delay costs [7],[8],[9],[10]. In [11], [12], [13] we presented solutions capable to integrate the data delivery and interest dissemination techniques. Duty cycling is a useful technique that alternates active and inactive periods to reduce the power consumption. In [14] we presented a protocol capable to automatically adapt the duty-cycle to the application needs. The protocol has been also tested to extend TETRA, a European standard for a trunked radio system, with WSNs [15].\nDelay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) exploit user mobility to deliver messages. In [16],[17],[18],[19],[20],][21] we propose a a reference architecture and a thorough quantitative evaluation of routing protocols for DTNs. Population protocols are used as a theoretical model for a collection (or population) of tiny mobile agents that interact with one another to carry out a computation. In [22] we evaluate the performance of population protocols on real face-to-face social networks of mobile users [25]. In [26] we studied how to exploit the energy scavenged by the pedestrian movements to enhance the operation time of the sensors. In [27],[28] we studied how to enhance the capabilities of multi-robot surveillance with WSNs.\nSimulation, Tools, Deployments and Devices The workflow for the deployment of a WSN usually foresees a preliminary simulation of the proposed solution to assess its performance. In this context, a key question is the validity of the simulation results. In [29],[30],[31],[32] we compared the simulation results with the ones obtained in a real test-bed. The debugging of WSN can be a labor-intensive and cumbersome task. In [33] we present a tool, basically a distributed network sniffer alongside the inspected sensor network. The ability of re-programming over-the-air (OTA) the nodes is crucial to fix bugs or enhance the functionalities on the nodes. Usually, OTA assume an always-on network. In [34] we presented a protocol capable to support OTA in network with a duty-cycle. In our lab on WSNs we developed the MagoNode [35], an embedded system based on a highly efficient RF front-end that greatly improves RF performance, in terms of radio range and sensibility, still limiting energy consumption. Indeed, the device outperforms other existing amplified platforms available on the market and is comparable to most commonly known unamplified motes. A network of cooperating tiny artifacts requires new programming models [36]. In [37] we explored the novel concept of virtual sensor networks, namely WSNs capable to adapt their behavior according to the user needs. the Internet of Underwater Things is probably the new frontier of WSNs. In [38] we presented the system to access the SUNRISE federation of facilities to test solutions for the Internet of Underwater Things. In [39] we started the investigation on the employment of WSNs to monitor critical infrastructures. This activity has been further developed in [40] where we presented the work done to monitor the structural health of a Rome B1 underground construction site by a WSNs. In [41],[42] a WSN has been used for noise pollution monitoring.\nPlant as sensors I have been the coordinator of the EU Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) project PLEASED. The aim of the project was the development of a technology capable of exploiting the plants as bio-sensors. In other words, PLEASED was an attempt to develop a kind interface between plants and computers, namely a plant-cyborg. Indeed, plants react to some external stimuli generating an electrical signal that can be captured by suitable devices (similarly to what happens in EMG). The main problem here is to develop a technology capable to uniquely identify the applied stimuli from the observed electrical signals. The idea of using plants as sensing devices has been first presented in [43]. In [44],[45],[46],[47] a number of machine learning techniques has been evaluated to classify the electrical signal generated by plants in response to heterogeneous stimuli. The main goal of this research was to identify a fingerprint in those electrical responses capable of discriminating the applied stimuli; this is indeed the main build block of a future employment of plants as bio-sensors.\nServices to the Users Localization During my stay in AT\u0026amp;T research lab in USA I had the opportunity of conducting a pioneering experimental activity on Cell-ID location techniques [48],[49] that also resulted in the application of of three provisional patents.\nPrivacy We initially considered the issues related to the implementation of state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives on resource constrained devices [50], [51] and mobile environments [52] Then we focused on the development of technical solutions capable to balance the tradeoff between the privacy of the users and the utility of the offered services [53], [54], [55], [56]. Current approaches in digital trials entail that private user data are provisioned to the trial investigator that is considered a trusted party. The aim of [57] is to present the technical requirements and the research challenges to secure the flow and control of personal data and to protect the interests of all the involved parties during the first phases of a clinical trial, namely the characterization of the potential patients and their possible recruitment. The proposed architecture will let the individuals keep their data private during these phases while providing a useful sketch of their data to the investigator. More recently, we started a research activity on blockchain technologies. This activity is focused on two main directions: a) the development of interesting use-cases to prove the applicability of such technology beyond the financial domain; in particular we used blockchain technologies to guarantee the quality of data in IoT based clinical trials [58] and to support the democratization of the decision processes in the smart cities [59]), b) the development of suitable software engineering techniques to reduce the risks in the development of decentralized applications [60].\nRecommendation systems Searching is probably the main functionality of the Web. In [61] we performed an experimental study of pre-fetching and caching algorithms for the world wide web. However, in modern applications recommendation systems play an equally important role taking advantage of Big Data to deliver personalized recommendations based on a visitor’s previous activities and those of other similar customers. Usually recommendation systems rely on centralized architectures. In [62],[63],[64], [65] we investigate the effectiveness of fully decentralized, collaborative filtering techniques. In [56] we propose a decentralized system capable to recommend new friendships to other users. In our proposal, the information needed to perform recommendation is collected and exchanged between users in a privacy preserving way.\nOther services The participation to the EU project CHIRON allowed us to understand the main components of a Next-Generation Remote Healthcare [66]. Also on the basis of this experience, we developed a simple system to deliver elder-care environments utilizing TV-channel based mechanisms [67]. The UX is also the main concept explored in [68] where we investigated an a ubiquitous touch-based remote grocery shopping process.\nIn [69],[70] we explored the concept of cooperative design supported by genetic algorithm. The selection of the products that will actually take part to the evolutionary process, relies on crowdsourcing mechanisms: only the most appreciated products survive.\nBibliography A likely more recent list of my publications can be found in:\n Google Scolar Scopus DBLP  [1] S.
