Various reasons recommend to keep private an original image, such as its economic value and its sensitive content. Several concrete scenarios, including selling images over the Internet, fighting misinformation and detecting deep fakes, would highly benefit from a system allowing to efficiently prove and verify the authenticity of a transformed image (i.e., the public image is a result of a faithful transformation over a private and authentic original image). We have designed a system allowing the possessor of a signed private image to compute a faithful transformation, guaranteeing 1) confidentiality (no leak), 2) efficient proof generation (the proof can be computed with a cheap laptop), 3) integrity (only the advertised transformations have been applied) and 4) efficient fraud detection (fast detection of bogus proofs). Our system is based on a divide-et-impera approach through sub-transformations applied to tiles of the original image that are then reconnected together along with their sub-proofs.
